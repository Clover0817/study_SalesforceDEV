REST API in Salesforce

REST API is a simple and powerful web service based on RESTful principles. <br/>
It exposes all sorts of Salesforce functionality via REST resources and HTTP methods. <br/>
For example, you can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) records, search or query your data, retrieve object metadata, and access information about limits in your org. REST API supports both XML and JSON.
