Salesforce Metadata vs Data <br/>
Data relates to the records that a business relies on, e.g. users, Accounts, Contacts, etc. <br/>
The actual business information stored inside the Salesforce org is “The Data”. When a customer’s contact information is added into the Account object, that's adding data. Each data item in Salesforce is known as a record.<br/>

Metadata is the data that describes data, the way that records behave and the “look and feel” of your Salesforce org. <br/>
The structure of a Salesforce org is encoded in “The Metadata”. When a user makes changes through the Salesforce Setup menu or adds a new Apex class, they're altering the metadata. <br/>

Salesforce Metadata Types<br/>
Data: The core components of the data structure on which most customization is built, e.g. custom objects, picklist value sets, and custom apps.<br/>
Programmability: Custom code developed on top of the platform, e.g. Flows, Apex classes, and Apex Triggers.<br/>
Presentation: Customization for how users interact with the platform, e.g. components, VisualForce and Lightning pages.<br/>
Custom metadata types: Go beyond the types that Salesforce provides out of the box. Supports complex data types for custom fields creation and storing information, e.g. mappings, business rules, and secrets.<br/>
