About With Sharing Keyword<br/>
Use the with sharing keyword on the class declaration.<br/>
The with sharing keyword ensures code respects the object-level, field-level, and record-level sharing settings for the user who is running the
Apex code. <br/>
This means that the code will only return records that the user has access to, according to their
Sharing Settings.<br/>
