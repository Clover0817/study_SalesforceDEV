You may be familiar with the two main relationship types: lookup relationships and master-detail relationships. <br/>
These allow you to create a normal parent-child relationship, which is sometimes referred to as a 1-to-many relationship.<br/>
This means there is only ever one parent, but multiple child records can be associated.<br/>
However, what happens when you need to connect “many” parents to “many” child records?<br/>
<br/>
Salesforce Junction Objects give you a way to create a many-to-many relationship between Salesforce objects.<br/>
They are created using a custom object to relate two other objects via two master-detail relationships.<br/>
This is necessary when modeling certain data schemas. Let’s dive into a couple of examples:<br/>
<br/>
Junction Object Examples<br/>
Take a recruitment process where you have a job position and candidate object. <br/>
As it is a requirement for candidates to apply to multiple job positions, a standard parent-child relationship would not work. <br/>
You need a junction object, called something along the lines of ‘Application’, to allow many candidates to apply to multiple job positions. <br/>
<br/>
Creating a junction object is simple, and once you’ve created your first one, the concept will become second nature.<br/>
